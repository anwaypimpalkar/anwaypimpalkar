# Hello there! 🧠🦾

My name is Anway. I am a Master's student pursuing Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, USA). My research interests are primarily in neuroengineering, particularly EEG and EMG based BCI/HCIs and prosthetics.

I previously completed my BTech in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at College of Engineering Pune (Pune, IN) in May 2023.
