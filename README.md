# Anway Pimpalkar ðŸ§  ðŸ¦¾

As a graduate student in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, my primary research focus lies in neuroengineering and biomedical device design, particularly BCI/HCIs and prosthetics. I also work on signal processing and machine learning methods for biosignal modalities, including EEG, ECG, and EMG.
