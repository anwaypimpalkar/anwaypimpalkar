# Hello there! ðŸ¦¾

My name is Anway. I am a Master's student pursuing Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, USA). My research interests are primarily in neuroengineering and neuroscience and I am looking to dive deeper into these fields.

I previously completed my BTech in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at COEP Technological University (Pune, IN) in May 2023.

- ðŸ§  I am currently working in the broad domain of neural signal processing at the Human Motor Neurophysiology and Neuromodulation Laboratory, IIT Bombay.
