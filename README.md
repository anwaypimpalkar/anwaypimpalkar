# Hello there! ðŸ’»

I am a final year B.Tech student pursuing Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at COEP Technological University (Pune, IN). My research interests are primarily in neuroengineering and neuroscience and I am looking to dive deeper into these fields.

In August 2023, I will be joining Johns Hopkins University, USA as an MSE Candidate majoring in Biomedical Engineering.

- ðŸ§  I am currently working in the broad domain of neural signal processing at the Human Motor Neurophysiology and Neuromodulation Laboratory, IIT Bombay.
